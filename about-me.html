        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <p class="about-me">
            Hello! I'm Brandon Rosen, also known online as ItzIcyHere or ItzIcyGaming. I'm an 11th grader as of 2024/2025 who is passionate about tech, <br>
            coding, and cybersecurity. One of my earlier projects, Shared Unblock Slides, was a major part of my life. It gained significant attention <br>
            by providing access to unblocked games and resources at school, and while I still feel a sense of pride in the technical skill it took to <br>
            create, I’ve grown to see it as a mistake.
<br><br>
            The experience taught me valuable lessons in ethics and responsibility. It showed me the importance of using my skills for good rather than <br>
            for rebellion or acts that could be seen as malicious. Since then, I’ve focused on positive growth, such as participating in my cybersecurity <br>
            class, contributing to my community through Key Club, and being one of only five students in my state invited to speak on a panel at an AI <br>
            Conference. These experiences have shaped my commitment to using technology to create a positive impact.
            <br><br>
            Now more about cybersecurity! <br>
            I have always been interested in tech, but my passion for it really took off when I started my cybersecurity class. I have learned <br>
            so much about the importance of cybersecurity and how it can be used to protect people and organizations from cyber threats. I have also <br>
            learned about different types of cyber threats and how to defend against them. I am excited to continue learning about cybersecurity and <br>
            hope to pursue a career in the field in the future. 
            <br><br>
            Some of the cerficiations I expect are CompTIA Security+, CompTIA Network+, Pentester+, Ethical Hacker Pro & more as I decide.
